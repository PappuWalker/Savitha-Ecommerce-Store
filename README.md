## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies:

## Why These Technologies Were Chosen

- **Next.js**: Provides server-side rendering capabilities essential for SEO and improved performance. Next.js's file-based routing simplifies navigation structure and its image optimization features significantly improve load times for product imagery.

- **React**: Offers component-based development, enabling reusable UI elements and maintainable code structure. React's virtual DOM ensures efficient updates, which is critical for interactive e-commerce features.

- **CSS3 with Custom Animations**: Delivers a premium feel with smooth transitions and responsive layouts without adding the overhead of external animation libraries.
